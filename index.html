      <p>I loved meeting new people during one of the group get togethers, I was a little nervous coming in because I
        didn't know what to expect but it all turned out better than I expected</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When I started coming to the club I felt intimidated, I didn't know what to expect. In my very first time
        coming, I just wanted to observe so I could see the interactions, some people chose to have one on one intimate
        talks and others chose to do group interactions, the members and coordinators all gave the club an extremely
        welcoming feeling. I almost felt like I knew some of these members my whole life, some of them had great insight
        to real life issues I was having and listened with intent, I also never felt forced to participate</p>

      <p>I joined the club because I wanted to force myself out of my shell, I wanted to meet new people and practice
        active listening with people other than my close circle. I truly feel that this club is helping me grow in all
        those areas and more. I'm happy to say that I have made 2 great friends here</p>

      <p>Heyo! I'm the mastermind behind this group created to bring the awesome power of extroverts and introverts together. I cant wait to welcome you into the group
      <br><br>
      My goal to achieve together with the group:
      <br><br>
      To help self proclaimed introverts to shine in front of the group, by sharing their ideas and opinions and to help self proclaimed extroverts find the joy in actively listening and delving into the deeper aspects of a relationship with members of the group
